# Agent and Tool Execution - Implementation Summary

## © 2025-2030 Ashutosh Sinha

## Overview
Added the ability to execute agents and tools directly from the Agents and Tools pages. Users can run agents and tools they have access to according to their permissions in users.json. Admin users have access to all agents and tools.

## Files

### 1. agents.html
**Changes:**
- Added "Capabilities" column to display agent capabilities
- Added "Actions" column with "Execute" button for each agent
- Execute button links to the agent execution form page

**New Table Structure:**
```
| Agent ID | Name | Description | Capabilities | Actions |
```

### 2. tools.html
**Changes:**
- Added "Actions" column with "Execute" button for each tool
- Execute button links to the tool execution form page

**New Table Structure:**
```
| Tool Name | Description | Actions |
```

## New Files Created

3. Enter input data as JSON
4. Click "Execute Agent"
5. View results in formatted output

### 4. execute_tool_form.html (NEW)
**Features:**
- Full-page form for executing tools

**User Flow:**
1. Click "Execute" on any tool from the Tools page
2. View tool details and input schema
3. Enter parameters as JSON
4. Click "Execute Tool"
5. View results in formatted output

## Access Control

The system respects user permissions defined in users.json:

- **Admin users**: Have access to all agents and tools
- **Regular users**: Can only see and execute agents/tools they have permission for
- Access is controlled at both the display level (only showing accessible items) and the API level (enforcing permissions)

The routes already implement this access control:
- `execute_agent_form`: Checks `user.has_agent_access(agent_id)`
- `execute_tool_form`: Checks `user.has_tool_access(tool_name)`
- API endpoints validate access before execution

## Backend Routes (Already Existed)

The following routes were already present in app.py and are now fully utilized:

- `GET /execute_agent/<agent_id>` - Display agent execution form
- `POST /api/execute_agent` - Execute an agent via API
- `GET /execute_tool/<tool_name>` - Display tool execution form
- `POST /api/execute_tool` - Execute a tool via API

## Features

### Agent Execution
- **Input Format**: JSON object with agent-specific fields
- **Example for Echo Agent**:
  ```json
  {
    "input": "Hello World!"
  }
  ```
- **Response**: Returns agent execution results with success status

### Tool Execution
- **Input Format**: JSON object with tool parameters
- **Example for Echo Tool**:
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Hello World!"
  }
  ```
- **Example for Stock Price Tool**:
  ```json
  {
    "symbol": "AAPL"
  }
  ```
- **Response**: Returns tool execution results with success status

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Easy Access**: Execute buttons directly on listing pages
2. **Clear Interface**: Dedicated pages for each execution with full context
3. **JSON Validation**: Immediate feedback on JSON syntax errors
4. **Visual Feedback**: Loading spinners and clear success/error messages
5. **Helpful Examples**: Sidebar with tips and example inputs
6. **Formatted Output**: Results displayed in readable, formatted JSON
7. **Schema Display**: Tools show their input schema for reference

## How to Use

1. **Deploy the files**:
   - Replace `templates/agents.html`
   - Replace `templates/tools.html`
   - Add `templates/execute_agent_form.html`
   - Add `templates/execute_tool_form.html`

2. **Execute an Agent**:
   - Go to Agents page
   - Click "Execute" on any agent you have access to
   - Enter JSON input data
   - Click "Execute Agent"
   - View results

3. **Execute a Tool**:
   - Go to Tools page
   - Click "Execute" on any tool you have access to
   - Enter JSON parameters
   - Click "Execute Tool"
   - View results

## Security

- Access control is enforced at multiple levels
- Users can only see and execute agents/tools they have permission for
- Admin users bypass permission checks
- JSON input is validated before execution
- Error messages don't expose sensitive system information

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test as admin user (should see and execute all agents/tools)
2. Test as regular user (should only see permitted agents/tools)
3. Test with valid JSON input
4. Test with invalid JSON (should show validation error)
5. Test with missing required parameters
6. Verify error handling for failed executions

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Form builder for tools with input schemas (instead of raw JSON)
- Execution history/logs
- Ability to save favorite input configurations
- Batch execution of multiple agents/tools
- Real-time execution progress for long-running tasks
