- Dynamic loop exit conditions

#### Conditional Branching
- Runtime decision making based on results
- Multiple execution paths
- Conditional routing and filtering

### ðŸ‘¥ Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
- Automatic checkpoint creation for human review
- Pause-and-resume capability
- Approval/rejection workflow

### ðŸ“Š State Management
- Fine-grained state tracking
- Context preservation across steps
- Result aggregation and passing

### ðŸ”— Hybrid Integration
- Seamless integration with existing DAG orchestrator
- Can use predefined DAGs when appropriate
- Fallback to traditional execution when needed

### Components

#### 1. Supervisor Graph
The core LangGraph workflow that orchestrates the planning process:
- **analyze_request**: Understands user intent
- **evaluate_resources**: Catalogs available capabilities
- **decide_strategy**: Chooses execution approach
- **construct_plan**: Builds detailed workflow
- **request_approval**: Gets user confirmation
- **execute_plan**: Runs the workflow
- **handle_hitl**: Manages human checkpoints
- **finalize**: Completes execution

#### 2. State Management
WorkflowState TypedDict tracks:
- User input and context
- Planning decisions
- Execution progress
- Results and errors
- HITL status
- Messages and logs

#### 3. Execution Engine
Handles different execution modes:
- **Sequential**: One step after another
- **Parallel**: Multiple steps simultaneously
- **Loop**: Repeated execution with conditions
- **Conditional**: Branching based on results

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from lgraph_planner import LangGraphPlanner, initialize_lgraph_tables

# Initialize
initialize_lgraph_tables()
planner = LangGraphPlanner(llm_provider='anthropic')

# Create a plan
result = planner.create_plan(
    user_id="user_123",
    session_id="session_456",
    user_request="Analyze Q4 sales data and create a report"
)

# Review the plan
print(f"Plan ID: {result['plan_id']}")
print(f"Plan Type: {result['plan_type']}")
print(f"Summary: {result['execution_plan']['details']}")

# Approve and execute
if result['pending_approval']:
    approval = planner.approve_plan(
        plan_id=result['plan_id'],
        user_id="user_123"
    )
    print(f"Workflow started: {approval['workflow_id']}")

# Monitor execution
status = planner.get_workflow_status(approval['workflow_id'])
print(f"Status: {status['status']}")
```

### Advanced Usage

#### Parallel Processing
```python
request = """
Process three data sources simultaneously:
1. Fetch weather data
2. Fetch stock prices  
3. Fetch news articles
Then combine and generate report
"""

result = planner.create_plan(user_id, session_id, request)
# Planner automatically detects parallel execution opportunity
```

#### Human-in-the-Loop
```python
request = """
Analyze customer feedback and draft responses.
I want to review before sending.
"""

result = planner.create_plan(user_id, session_id, request)
# Planner adds HITL checkpoint automatically

# After execution reaches checkpoint
planner.approve_hitl(hitl_id, user_id, "Responses look good")
```

#### Looping Workflow
```python
request = """
Monitor API endpoint every 5 minutes.
Alert if response time > 2s.
Stop after 1 hour or when stable.
"""

result = planner.create_plan(user_id, session_id, request)
# Planner creates loop with conditions
```

## Database Schema

### lgraph_plans
Stores plan definitions and approval status:
```sql
CREATE TABLE lgraph_plans (
    plan_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    session_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    user_request TEXT,
    plan_type TEXT,
    execution_plan TEXT,
    plan_summary TEXT,
    status TEXT,
    created_at TEXT,
    approved_at TEXT,
    approved_by TEXT,
    rejected_at TEXT,
    rejected_by TEXT,
    rejection_reason TEXT
)
```

### lgraph_workflows
Tracks workflow execution:
```sql
CREATE TABLE lgraph_workflows (
    workflow_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    plan_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    session_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    status TEXT,
    started_at TEXT,
    completed_at TEXT,
    results TEXT,
    error TEXT
)
```

### lgraph_step_logs
Records individual step execution:
```sql
CREATE TABLE lgraph_step_logs (
    log_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    workflow_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    step_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    result TEXT,
    success BOOLEAN,
    executed_at TEXT
)
```

### lgraph_hitl_requests
Manages human-in-the-loop checkpoints:
```sql
CREATE TABLE lgraph_hitl_requests (
    hitl_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    workflow_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    plan_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    checkpoint TEXT,
    message TEXT,
    status TEXT,
    created_at TEXT,
    responded_at TEXT,
    responded_by TEXT,
    response TEXT
)
```

## Integration with Existing System

### Registries
The LangGraph Planner integrates with existing registries:

```python
# Uses AgentRegistry
self.agent_registry = AgentRegistry()
agents = self.agent_registry.list_agents()

# Uses ToolRegistry  
self.tool_registry = ToolRegistry()
tools = self.tool_registry.list_tools()

# Uses DAGRegistry
self.dag_registry = DAGRegistry()
dags = self.dag_registry.list_dags()
```

### Orchestrator
Can delegate to traditional orchestrator:

```python
if plan_type == PlanType.USE_EXISTING_DAG:
    # Use existing WorkflowOrchestrator
    from orchestrator import WorkflowOrchestrator
    orchestrator = WorkflowOrchestrator()
    workflow_id = orchestrator.start_workflow(...)
```

## Configuration

### LLM Provider
Choose between different LLM providers:

```python
# Use Anthropic Claude
planner = LangGraphPlanner(llm_provider='anthropic')

# Use OpenAI
planner = LangGraphPlanner(llm_provider='openai')

# Use mock for testing
planner = LangGraphPlanner(llm_provider='mock')
```

### Execution Modes
The planner automatically selects the best mode, but you can influence it through request phrasing:

- **Sequential**: "First do X, then Y, then Z"
- **Parallel**: "Simultaneously fetch A, B, and C"
- **Loop**: "Monitor every N minutes until..."
- **Conditional**: "If X then Y, otherwise Z"

## Decision Making Logic

### Strategy Selection
The supervisor uses this logic:

```python
1. Analyze user request
   - Extract intent and complexity
   - Identify key requirements
   
2. Evaluate resources
   - List available agents
   - List available tools
   - List available DAGs
   
3. Decide strategy
   IF matching DAG exists AND request is straightforward:
       â†’ Use existing DAG
   ELSE IF request is complex OR requires novel approach:
       â†’ Create custom StateGraph
   ELSE:
       â†’ Simple sequential execution
       
4. Construct detailed plan
   - Break down into steps
   - Assign agents/tools
   - Identify parallel opportunities
   - Add HITL checkpoints if needed
   
5. Request approval
   - Generate human-readable summary
   - Wait for user confirmation
   
6. Execute
   - Run workflow with state management
   - Handle HITL if required
   - Track progress and results
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Clear Request Phrasing
Good:
```
"Fetch stock prices for AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT in parallel, 
then calculate portfolio value"
```

Better:
```
"I need to:
1. Get current stock prices for AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT (can be parallel)
2. Calculate total portfolio value
3. Compare with yesterday's value
4. Alert me if change > 5%"
```

### 2. Specify HITL Requirements
```
"Analyze customer complaints and draft responses.
Please let me review the responses before sending."
```

### 3. Define Loop Conditions
```
"Monitor system health every 5 minutes.
Alert if CPU > 80% or memory > 90%.
Continue for 2 hours or until metrics are normal for 30 minutes."
```

### 4. Leverage Existing Resources
The planner considers existing DAGs, so keep your DAG library updated with commonly used workflows.

## Error Handling

### Plan Rejection
```python
# User can reject plans
planner.reject_plan(
    plan_id=plan_id,
    user_id=user_id,
    reason="Need more detailed analysis steps"
)

# Then create modified plan
new_result = planner.create_plan(
    user_id=user_id,
    session_id=session_id,
    user_request=modified_request
)
```

### Workflow Failures
```python
# Check workflow status
status = planner.get_workflow_status(workflow_id)

if status['status'] == 'failed':
    print(f"Error: {status.get('error')}")
    
    # Retry with modified approach
    # or investigate failed steps
    for step in status['steps']:
        if not step['success']:
            print(f"Failed step: {step['step_id']}")
```

## Performance Considerations

### Parallel Execution
- Automatically identifies independent tasks
- Reduces overall execution time
- Manages resource allocation

### State Management
- Efficient state passing between nodes
- Minimal serialization overhead
- Context-aware execution

### Caching
- Plans can be reused for similar requests
- Step results cached when appropriate
- Reduces redundant LLM calls

## Security

### Approval Required
- All plans require user approval before execution
- Users review detailed execution steps
- Can reject risky operations

### HITL Checkpoints
- Sensitive operations pause for human review
- User controls critical decision points
- Audit trail of all approvals

### Access Control
- User ID tracked throughout workflow
- Session-based isolation
- Database-level security

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Workflow Status
```python
status = planner.get_workflow_status(workflow_id)

print(f"Overall Status: {status['status']}")
print(f"Completed Steps: {len(status['steps'])}")

for step in status['steps']:
    print(f"Step {step['step_id']}: {step['success']}")
    if not step['success']:
        print(f"  Error: {step['result']}")
```

### Plan Details
```python
plan = planner.get_plan(plan_id)

print(f"Plan Type: {plan['plan_type']}")
print(f"Steps: {len(plan['execution_plan']['details']['steps'])}")
print(f"\nSummary:\n{plan['plan_summary']}")
```

### Logging
All major events are logged:
- Plan creation
- Approval/rejection
- Step execution
- HITL requests
- Workflow completion/failure

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Learning from History**: Improve planning based on past executions
2. **Cost Estimation**: Predict execution time and resource usage
3. **Optimization Suggestions**: Recommend efficiency improvements
4. **Template Creation**: Convert successful plans into reusable DAGs
5. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Complex tasks with agent coordination
6. **Real-time Monitoring UI**: Visual workflow execution tracking

### Experimental Features
- Self-healing workflows (automatic error recovery)
- Dynamic resource scaling
- Predictive planning based on patterns
- Natural language workflow queries

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Planner always creates simple sequential plans
**Solution**: Provide more detailed requests with explicit parallelization hints

**Issue**: Plans not being approved
**Solution**: Check database for plan status, verify approval workflow

**Issue**: HITL checkpoints not triggering
**Solution**: Explicitly mention review requirements in request

**Issue**: Workflow stuck in "running" state
**Solution**: Check step logs for failed steps, implement timeout handling

## Contributing

When extending the LangGraph Planner:

1. **Add New Execution Modes**: Extend `ExecutionMode` enum and implement handler
2. **Custom State Fields**: Add to `WorkflowState` TypedDict
3. **New Decision Logic**: Modify `_decide_strategy` method
4. **Additional Nodes**: Add nodes to supervisor graph
