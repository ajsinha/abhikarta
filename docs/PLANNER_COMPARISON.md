# Planner Comparison: Traditional DAG vs LangGraph


## © 2025-2030 Ashutosh Sinha


## Executive Summary

The Abhikarta system now offers **two complementary planning approaches**:

1. **Traditional DAG Planner** (`planner.py`): Pre-defined, static workflows
2. **LangGraph Planner** (`lgraph_planner.py`): Dynamic, AI-powered workflows

Both have their place in the system and can be used together based on your needs.

## Detailed Comparison

### 1. Workflow Definition

#### Traditional DAG
```json
{
  "dag_id": "data_pipeline",
  "name": "Data Processing Pipeline",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "node_id": "fetch",
      "node_type": "agent",
      "agent_id": "data_fetcher",
      "dependencies": []
    },
    {
      "node_id": "process",
      "node_type": "agent",
      "agent_id": "data_processor",
      "dependencies": ["fetch"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Pros:**
- Clear, declarative structure
- Easy to review and version
- IDE support (JSON schema validation)

**Cons:**
- Requires understanding of system internals
- Time-consuming to create
- No flexibility for variations

#### LangGraph Planner
```python
request = "Fetch data from API and process it"
result = planner.create_plan(user_id, session_id, request)
```

**Pros:**
- Natural language interface
- Instant workflow generation
- Adapts to context

**Cons:**
- Less explicit control
- Requires LLM
- May need refinement

---

### 2. Execution Model

#### Traditional DAG
```python
from orchestrator import WorkflowOrchestrator
from dag.dag_registry import DAGRegistry

registry = DAGRegistry()
graph = registry.create_graph_from_dag("data_pipeline")

orchestrator = WorkflowOrchestrator()
workflow_id = orchestrator.start_workflow(
    dag_id="data_pipeline",
    session_id=session_id,
    user_id=user_id,
    graph=graph
)
```

- Direct execution
- No planning overhead
- Fixed execution path

#### LangGraph Planner
```python
from lgraph_planner import LangGraphPlanner

planner = LangGraphPlanner()
result = planner.create_plan(user_id, session_id, request)
approval = planner.approve_plan(result['plan_id'], user_id)
```

- Planning phase (LLM calls)
- Approval workflow
- Dynamic execution path

---

### 3. Parallel Execution

#### Traditional DAG
```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "node_id": "fetch1",
      "dependencies": []
    },
    {
      "node_id": "fetch2",
      "dependencies": []
    },
    {
      "node_id": "combine",
      "dependencies": ["fetch1", "fetch2"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Manual parallelization:**
- Explicitly define dependencies
- Clear execution graph
- Requires planning ahead

#### LangGraph Planner
```python
request = "Fetch data from API1 and API2 simultaneously, then combine"
result = planner.create_plan(user_id, session_id, request)
```

**Automatic parallelization:**
- AI detects parallel opportunities
- Natural language specification
- Adapts to request

---

### 4. Conditional Logic

#### Traditional DAG
Limited conditional support:
- Requires custom node types
- Complex to implement
- Static conditions only

```json
{
  "node_id": "conditional_node",
  "node_type": "conditional",
  "config": {
    "condition": "status == 'success'",
    "true_branch": "success_handler",
    "false_branch": "error_handler"
  }
}
```

#### LangGraph Planner
Native conditional support:
```python
request = """
Check API status.
If healthy: proceed with data fetch
If unhealthy: send alert and retry in 5 minutes
"""
result = planner.create_plan(user_id, session_id, request)
```

---

### 5. Human-in-the-Loop

#### Traditional DAG
```json
{
  "node_id": "approval",
  "node_type": "human_in_loop",
  "config": {
    "message": "Please review and approve"
  }
}
```

**Manual HITL:**
- Explicit HITL nodes
- Fixed approval points
- Predictable flow

#### LangGraph Planner
```python
request = "Process data, then let me review before saving"
result = planner.create_plan(user_id, session_id, request)
```

**Smart HITL:**
- AI detects review needs
- Natural language specification
- Context-aware checkpoints

---

### 6. Loop Support

#### Traditional DAG
Not natively supported:
- Would require complex custom implementation
- Limited to fixed iterations
- Difficult to maintain

#### LangGraph Planner
Native loop support:
```python
request = """
Monitor API every 5 minutes.
Continue for 1 hour or until response time < 1s for 15 minutes.
"""
result = planner.create_plan(user_id, session_id, request)
```

---

## Performance Comparison

### Traditional DAG Performance

```
Setup Time: 1-2 hours (create JSON)
Planning Time: 0ms (no planning needed)
Execution Time: Fast (native Python)
Total Time: 1-2 hours + execution

Cost: $0 (no LLM)
Reuse Value: High (reusable forever)
```

**Best for:** Repeated executions, production workflows

### LangGraph Planner Performance

```
Setup Time: 1-2 minutes (write request)
Planning Time: 2-5s (LLM calls)
Execution Time: Fast (native Python)
Total Time: 2-5 minutes + execution

Cost: $0.01-0.10 per plan (LLM API)
Reuse Value: Medium (plans stored, can reuse)
```

**Best for:** One-off tasks, exploratory work

---

## Cost Analysis

### Traditional DAG
- **Development**: 1-2 hours @ $100/hr = $100-200
- **Execution**: $0
- **100 executions**: $100-200 (one-time)
- **Cost per execution**: $1-2 (amortized)

**Break-even at:** ~10-20 executions

### LangGraph Planner
- **Development**: 1-2 minutes @ $100/hr = ~$2
- **Planning**: $0.05 (LLM)
- **Execution**: $0
- **100 executions**: $2 + $5 = $7
- **Cost per execution**: $0.07

**Break-even at:** Never (always cheaper for <1000 executions)

**Conclusion:** Use LangGraph for infrequent tasks, Traditional DAG for high-frequency

---

## Migration Path

### From Traditional to LangGraph

If you have existing DAGs, you can:

1. **Keep them** - LangGraph can use existing DAGs
2. **Hybrid approach** - Use both based on task type
3. **Gradual migration** - Convert high-value DAGs over time

```python
# LangGraph automatically detects and uses existing DAGs
request = "Run my data processing pipeline"
result = planner.create_plan(user_id, session_id, request)

# If matching DAG exists, uses it:
if result['plan_type'] == 'use_existing_dag':
    print(f"Using existing DAG: {result['selected_dag_id']}")
```

### From LangGraph to Traditional

Convert successful LangGraph plans to DAGs:

```python
# Get successful plan
plan = planner.get_plan(plan_id)
execution_plan = plan['execution_plan']['details']

# Convert to DAG JSON
dag_config = {
    "dag_id": f"converted_{plan_id}",
    "name": plan['user_request'][:50],
    "nodes": [
        {
            "node_id": step['step_id'],
            "node_type": step['type'],
            "agent_id": step.get('agent_id'),
            "dependencies": step.get('dependencies', [])
        }
        for step in execution_plan['steps']
    ]
}

# Save as traditional DAG
dag_registry.add_dag(dag_config)
```

---

## Hybrid Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Standard + Custom

```python
def execute_workflow(request: str):
    """Try traditional first, fallback to LangGraph"""
    
    # Check for existing DAG
    dag_registry = DAGRegistry()
    matching_dag = find_matching_dag(request)
    
    if matching_dag:
        # Use traditional orchestrator
        return execute_traditional_dag(matching_dag)
    else:
        # Use LangGraph planner
        return execute_langgraph_plan(request)
```

### Pattern 2: Planned + Ad-hoc

```python
# Regular scheduled workflows use Traditional DAG
def scheduled_job():
    orchestrator.start_workflow(dag_id="daily_report", ...)

# User requests use LangGraph
def user_request(request: str):
    planner.create_plan(user_id, session_id, request)
```

### Pattern 3: Template + Variation

```python
# Base workflow as traditional DAG
base_dag = "data_processing_template"

# Variations use LangGraph
request = f"Use the {base_dag} workflow but add extra validation"
result = planner.create_plan(user_id, session_id, request)
```

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Daily Report Generation

**Best Choice: Traditional DAG**

Why:
- Same workflow every day
- Predictable steps
- Cost matters (365 executions/year)
- Production stability required

```json
{
  "dag_id": "daily_report",
  "nodes": [
    {"node_id": "fetch_data", ...},
    {"node_id": "analyze", ...},
    {"node_id": "generate_report", ...},
    {"node_id": "email_report", ...}
  ]
}
```

### Scenario 2: Customer Request Analysis

**Best Choice: LangGraph Planner**

Why:
- Each request is unique
- Requires understanding context
- Conditional logic needed
- Infrequent (10-20 times/month)

```python
request = """
Analyze this customer's issue and:
- If technical: route to engineering
- If billing: check payment history and suggest solution
- If feedback: categorize and log
"""
result = planner.create_plan(user_id, session_id, request)
```

### Scenario 3: System Monitoring

**Best Choice: Traditional DAG (with LangGraph for alerts)**

Why:
- Monitoring runs continuously (high frequency)
- Alert handling varies (low frequency)

```python
# Monitoring: Traditional DAG
orchestrator.start_workflow(dag_id="system_monitor", ...)

# Alert Response: LangGraph
request = "CPU at 95% on prod-server-3, investigate and mitigate"
result = planner.create_plan(user_id, session_id, request)
```
